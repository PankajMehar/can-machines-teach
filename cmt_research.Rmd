# Automatic Question and Answer Generative Methods

1. We can think  of it as a seq2seq learning problem; In this paper [QG-Net: A Data-Driven Question Generation Model
for Educational Content](http://www.princeton.edu/~shitingl/papers/18l@s-qgen.pdf). They use a bi-directional LSTM network to process the input context words sequence.

2. In this summary [Learning to Ask](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~xdu/papers/acl17_dsc_poster.pdf), they used a sentence- and paragraph-level seq2seq model to read text from the input content and generate a question about the input sentence. 


3. In this paper [TOPIC-BASED QUESTION GENERATION](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rk3pnae0b), they proposed a topic-based question generation algorithm. The algorithm will be able to take in a input sentence, a topic and a question type; then generate a word sequence related to the topic, question type and the input sentence. 

They are formulating a conditional likelihood objective function to achieve this goal. 

Also, in the paper, they proposed a few frameworks that were used to tackle this problem. The first type is seq2seq model. This model typically uses a bidirectional LSTM as the encoder to encode a sentence and a LSTM as the decoder to generate the target question. 
The second approach is question pattern prediction and question topic selection algorithms. It takes in an automatically selected phrase Q and fill this phrase into the pattern that was predicted from pre-mined patterns, which is not done with deep learning. 

The last approach is multi-source seq2seq learning which aims to integrate information from multiple sources to boost learning.
