# Automatic Question and Answer Generative Methods

1. We can think  of it as a seq2seq learning problem; In this paper [QG-Net: A Data-Driven Question Generation Model
for Educational Content](http://www.princeton.edu/~shitingl/papers/18l@s-qgen.pdf). They use a bi-directional LSTM network to process the input context words sequence.
