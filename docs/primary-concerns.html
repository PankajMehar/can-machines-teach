<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Primary Concerns</h1>
<p>There are 3 popular concerns that I will attempt to address in this article about online learning in the present and near future. I will attempt to address them here and in the implementation section.</p>
<p>The first concern we have is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Passive Consumption</strong> - most of online content is viewed passively by the learner and the result of passive consumption is that learner’s do not grasp the concepts or master the content being taught.</li>
<li><strong>Untested Knowledge</strong> - even if the learner was engaged while viewing a piece of educational content their knowledge is untested and therefore it isn’t clear if they’ve mastered the content accurately and in some sense holistically.</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge Representation</strong> - even if the learner was engaged and their knowledge was tested, simply knowing the counts or types of video they watched doesn’t make their knowledge predictable and useful to others. In fact, most people are unaware of all the content they’ve consumed over the years and cannot synthesise it as well as they possible could.</li>
</ul>
<div id="knowledge-ecosystem-example" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Knowledge Ecosystem Example</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/knowledgeEcosystem.png" alt="Knowledge Ecosystem" />
<p class="caption">Knowledge Ecosystem</p>
</div>
<p>Let us put forward an example the matches each of these concerns. But in order to do so we need to lay out the our eco In order to address the concerns above we have put together the basic components of this knowledge system. We have also mentioned that we will focus on the <em>digital</em> aspects as we believe it presents the biggest leap forward for knowledge representation.</p>
<p>An ecosystem</p>
</div>
<div id="passive-consumption-and-untested-knowledge" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Passive Consumption and Untested Knowledge</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How would such an ecosystem insure us against passive consumption?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, I’ve bundled passive consumption and untested knowledge because our proposed system approaches both of these by always testing knowledge.</p>
<p>Given a piece of educational content, our knowledge system will generate a set of questions and answers that theoretically capture the major concepts and facts that the learner should know after viewing a part or the content in whole.</p>
<p>You can imagine watching a Youtube video and after a learner views 15 minutes of an hour long lecture on computational complexity a quiz is presented (a set of questions and answers conditioned on the past 15 minutes of video,) and the results are recorded. In the future we would also be able to use the knowledge graph</p>
<p>The knowledge system would only consider content that has been watched with some engagement or if they can test out of the content.</p>
