<p>Let’s start with a future view of an individual’s education. Many of us have used the internet to educate ourselves with the abundance of medium to high quality videos, papers, articles, podcasts and how-tos being uploaded from numerous individuals, groups, and institutions like never before (60 hours of video are uploaded to youtube.com every minute). Let us imagine that all of what you have learned online, throughout the entirety of your life, from the hundreds of Youtube videos, Wikipedia articles, Nature papers, and podcasts you’ve read, watched, or listened to, were all added structurally to your <strong>education journey</strong> and what if that could be consolidated into what we might call a <strong>digital education footprint</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>digital education footprint</strong> would tie together our <strong>education journey</strong> into a concrete representation of an individual’s education. For most of this article we will focus on the digital side but you can easily imagine how this system could take inputs from more formal and/or offline settings. It’s goal would be to showcase the broad range of an individual’s true knowledge (making digital music) as well as the places they’ve went deeper than most (deep learning or philosophy of mathematics).</p>
<p>This footprint, would be stable and have shared propertie; those who are deep in math should have comprable footprints, but evolution should be a key property of the system. As the individual’s update their knowledge, so to will their <em>digital education footprint</em>. This is in contrast to our current approach to education as a monolithic phase of our lives, this footprint would promote the pursuit of human knowledge as a life-long journey as it should be.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/vizzy.png" alt="Visualed over time - From arxiv" />
<p class="caption">Visualed over time - From arxiv</p>
</div>
<p>Visualised over time, we would be able to see an individual’s <strong>education journey</strong>. An individual’s <strong>education journey</strong> along with their footprint, would provide a medium for the individual to be directed (mentors/teachers) by mentors or guides who might suggest a change of course with the goal of helping the learner to gain the right knowledge to become a competent individual or better yet to master one’s self. An employee could use the <strong>education journey</strong> to find the best candidates for a job that puts the learner knowledge and passions to use. If one is just getting started, then one can view all of the common journey’s that others have taken offline and online and correlate someone’s life work or occupation to their specific <strong>knowledge journey</strong> to learn what they should do. Because we currently don’t know what the world looks like in terms of what individuals know except their formal education, we are probably in for a surprise. We could stretch and disrupt our current categorical buckets by showing people the common and uncommon journey’s and correlate their outcomes. We could then use unsupervised learning to cluster <strong>knowledge journeys</strong> to create new to the world subjects and <strong>knowledge journeys</strong>. We can then use these synthesised journeys to better guide the individual and understand collective human knowledge.</p>
<p>In this essay, I will propose a new way to approach education which will require significant effort to bring to life but I believe the benefits will surely outweigh the costs. I’ll talk about how we can use machine learning and deep learning in particular to help create our <strong>digital education footprint</strong>, <strong>learner journeys</strong>, and a collective human knowledge graph. This will allow us to take the space of unstructured educational content and begin to map it unto a knowledge graph and use generative models to make educational content engaging and test a learner’s knowledge no matter the subject. I will name a few benefits of such a future.</p>
<ul>
<li>A society where individuals do not simply compete for a degree but where they can feel safe to create their own unique journey through human knowledge and still be recognised and predictable to others</li>
<li>A society where an individual’s knowledge is derived not from what we know about a degree but by their actual knowledge which is alive and therefore always evolving</li>
<li>A society that better understands itself, through the understanding of the many journey’s it’s members have taken and the collective knowledge that has gone mostly unaccounted for in today’s degree based education.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will also show that this imagined future is not only <strong>desirable</strong> for society but also that much of it is currently feasible mainly due to the most recent advances in machine learning, and in particular deep learning, which will enable us to begin designing such a future today.</p>
