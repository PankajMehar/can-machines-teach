<p>Let’s start with a future view of an individual’s education. Many of us have used the internet to educate ourselves with the abundance of high quality videos, papers, articles, podcasts and how-tos being upload from numerous individuals, groups, and institutions like never before (60 hours of video are uploaded to youtube.com every minute). Let us imagine that all of what you have learned online, throughout the entirety of your life, from the hundreds of Youtube videos, Wikipedia articles, Nature papers, and podcasts you’ve read, watched, or listened to, were all consolidated into what we might call a <strong>digital education footprint</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>digital education footprint</strong> would string together our online education into a concrete representation of an individual’s online education and could be extended into more formal settings. It’s goal would be to showcase the broad range of an individual’s knowledge (making digital music) as well as the places they’ve went deeper than most (deep learning or philosophy of mathematics).</p>
<p>This footprint, would be stable but always evolving as individual’s update their knowledge while also being comprable to others.So instead of approaching education as a monolithic phase of our lives, this footprint would promote education as a life-long journey.</p>
<p>It would also (combined with traditional education) begin to show us a more accurate depiction of an individual’s true knowledge. With every new year, their footprint would evolve just as the very thread of their lives would. Visualised over time, we would be able to see an individual’s <strong>knowledge journey</strong>. This could also serve as a way for others who may be on similar <strong>knowledge journey</strong> or those who were looking for a change. You would be able to correlate someone’s life work or occupation to their <strong>knowledge journey</strong> and eventually begin to find and cluster similar journeys that could emerge through unsupervised learning leading to whole new subjects or journeys that others could follow.</p>
<p>In this essay, I will propose a new way to approach education which will require significant effort to bring to life but I believe the benefits will surely outweigh the costs. I’ll talk about how we can use machine learning and deep learning in particular to help create our <strong>digital education footprint</strong>, <strong>student journeys</strong>, and a collective human knowledge graph. This will allow us to take the space of unstructured educational content and begin to map it unto a knowledge graph and use generative models to make educational content engaging and test a student’s knowledge no matter the subject. I will name a few benefits of such a future.</p>
<ul>
<li>A society where individuals do not simply compete for a degree but where they can feel safe to create their own unique journey through human knowledge and still be recognised and predictable to others</li>
<li>A society where an individual’s knowledge is derived not from what we know about a degree but by their actual knowledge which is alive and therefore always evolving</li>
<li>A society that better understands itself, through the understanding of the many journey’s it’s members have taken and the collective knowledge that has gone mostly unaccounted for in today’s degree based education.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will also show that this imagined future is not only <strong>desirable</strong> for society but also that much of it is currently feasible mainly due to the most recent advances in machine learning, and in particular deep learning, which will enable us to begin designing such a future today.</p>
