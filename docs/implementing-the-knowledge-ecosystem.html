<p>In this section, we are set to solve the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How might we approach designing such a system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will walk you through some possible implementations of the proposed knowledge ecosystem. I will be presenting the current research in machine learning that is relevant to each component of the knowledge ecosystem and also discuss this new artificial neural network architecture EC2VQA and one possible instansitation of that.</p>
<p>Note that this is not the blueprint, each of these components can be developed independently and vary from what you find here. This is a provocation for getting started on the knowledge ecosystem today.</p>
<div id="problem-formulation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Problem Formulation</h2>
<p>Building such a digital knowledge ecosystem like the one we just visioned is not a trivial task. We would need to break this ecosystem into few key sub-elements as below so that we can set out to tackle them one by one.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>LEARNING + FEEDBACK</strong> – given a learner consumes a piece of educational content, reliably evaluate their knowledge and provide the feedback for improvement to support their learning. (credibility, rigour)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>KNOWLEDGE GRAPH</strong> – general knowledge blueprint as a map to piece together all the content that is currently available. (relatibility, predictability)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>KNOWLEDGE JOURNEYS</strong> – given a piece of educational content, classify it within a knowledge graph; given multiple learner journeys, create a way to customize their own growth journey while offereing a way for them them to compare, connect with and follow, other’s journey (compare, traverse, curiosity)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>KNOWLEDGE FOOTPRINT</strong> – given a learner’s journey, collapse it into a representative symbol(s) (digital education footprint) (relatibility, stable but evolving system )</p></li>

<p>Much of the element #1 and #2 have been made possible with the recent breakthoughs in machine learning especially in the filed of deep learning. A few other pieces like the element #3 and #4 may require a more advanced framework that has not been proposed yet to best resolve. Let’s first take a look at some methods that might come handy when applying to our problems.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Before we start…</h2>
<p>As what we discussed above, one of the possible and optimal solutions so far for building our ecosystem is using current state-of-art deep learning algorithms in the related domains. Here I will walk you through some thought provinking research summary in a form of survey.</p>
<p>To best illustrate the problem and possible solutions, we will for now reduce the complexity of the problem. Keep in mind that our ultimate goal is to be able to apply our system to any type of online available educational content. As what we have mentioned earlier, educational videos seem to be one of the top options for people when it comes to knowledge consumption. Let’s explore some of the solutions that can enable us to apply our system on those video educational content.</p>
