<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Concerns</h1>
<p>There are 3 popular concerns that I will attempt to address in this article about online learning in the present and the future. I will attempt to address them here and in the implementation section below.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first concern is that the learning is often passive</li>
<li>The second concern is that the information remains untested and therefore doesn’t truly make the leap from information to true knowledge.</li>
<li>The third concern is that even if the two concerns above were met definitively, it would not be possible to .</li>
</ul>
<div id="passive-consumption" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Passive Consumption</h2>
<p>It has been argued and shown in some studies[insert studies], that many people who consume videos or other forms of educational content online, especially when outside the context of school, are often consuming the content passively. This leads to what a colleague called “swiss-cheese learning”, where one learns a bit here and there, lacking any real rigour or depth providing very little probability of capturing the major concepts or mastering the content in any adequate sense.</p>
<p>This is a concern that is widely observed. Passive watching is not equivelent to learning. There are many variables that are related to this including those that are cultural and biological.</p>
<p>Here I’ll focus on two points. I argue that educational content online expects the content to help a learner reach a particular goal. There is nothing in the content itself, or the platforms, that reach out to reinforce or to verify the knowledge one has gained.</p>
<p>I will argue that some key elements of these features that these issues are Engagement can be increased if x, goal directed behaviour can be enhance by small learning goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Engagement</li>
<li>Goal-Directed</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>People watch videos casually and on the fly—and they rarely turn their phones sideways to do it. - Facebook Ads</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="untested-knowledge" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Untested Knowledge</h2>
<p>It has been argued that it is hard to verify what someone has learned while consuming educational content online. This is generally true outside of those content producers who combine content and testing (i.e. Khan Academy, Udacity, Coursera) but they are generally limited compared to the vast amount of videos that are available that lack this testing.</p>
<p>The knowledge</p>
</div>
<div id="predictability" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Predictability</h2>
<p>Concerns #1 and #2 can be solved and it could serve the individual who is seeking to master the content of a particular or several subjects. An individual could find themselves engaging with the goal of mastering the subjects, knowing that their grasp of the knowledge would be tested.</p>
<p>But it does not solve the societal issue. If you are like myself, you have watched more videos and read more articles online than you did when you were in school. Possibly much more. But how does one make sense of such consumption since it is largely unstructured and from various individuals and institutions. Let us take degrees and their success in making an individual’s ability predictabe. A degree not only makes an individual predictable, in fact, it makes a whole class of individuals predictable on one crucial dimension. When we know one has a BA in Mathematics we know that they should have some knowledge of mathematics. We can imagine that an individual with such a degree has working knowledge of a familiar set of subjects (even if one doesn’t know much about mathematics) and also the type of work they might be able to do. This is because of the traditions of our educational institutions and practices. The predictability is due to our past knowledge of what a particular subject is about and the occupational outcomes of such knowledge. The bad part is that degrees are beginning to tell less and less of the story. So for all of it’s ability to reduce the complexity of gained knowledge, it is too limiting to represent a user’s true level of knowledge.</p>
<p>So Online educational content consumption does not</p>

<div id="teaching-machine" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Teaching Machine</h2>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/MtoQA.png" alt="Image title" />
<p class="caption">Image title</p>
</div>
<p>So how would a universal teaching machine eclipse these challenges? We will present a solution that meets all three criteria by introudcing a theoretical artificial network architecture to cover the first two.</p>
<p>neural then cover each concept in detail. Our idea of a digital education footprint, journeys, and a knowledge graph will provide us with what we need to take a first stab at encompassing a learner’s whole education by addressing the three concerns.</p>
<p>In order to take all of our videos</p>
</div>
<div id="the-components" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> The components</h2>
<p>A component of a universal teaching machine should be able to take any of the billions of educational content online (and eventualyl off) and by using machine learning and deep learning techniques complete the following: - assign it to a one or more knowledge subjects (i.e. math, design, computer science) - generate a set of adequate questions and answers that test the learner’s (what is x? a, b, c, or d) knowledge throughout the learning session</p>
</div>
<div id="from-data-to-wisdom-dikw" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> From Data to Wisdom (DIKW)</h2>
<p>Over time, it is plausible, that our digital education footprint would be the most important representation of an individuals level of education. Even more important than our primary education; it has done much to make us predictable, but it has sacrificed the true range of an individual’s gained knowledge and wisdom coming from any other place than the institution is willing to give credit for.</p>
<p>Since we’ve largely rely upon large institutions to educate groups of individuals, many have grown deeply familiar with having a perfectly demarcated path towards a degree, so it has been much harder for individuals to use this abundance of knowledge to chart their own educational journey in today’s fast moving world.</p>
<p>being us how to the peer pressure of cohorts, self-learning learned Imagine that if you signed up for a job, your primary consideration and also your digital education could be conveyed as a path through the web that others attempt to follow or mix and match. Now let us imagine a world where our digital education fingerprint allowed us to</p>
