<p>Next, we need to consider how we can select an adequate and relevant learning masterial and generate an effecive learning map for the learners based on their current progress and the general knowledge graph/map, given the ever growing amount of educational content on the web.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, learning is a knowledge accumulation process. Knowledge itself has its unique structure that can help us learn in a most effective and productive way. Knowledge Graph is a great tool that we developed to map and present the structure of knolwedge. In shirt, knowledge graphs are collections of relational facts, where each fact states that a certrain relation holds between 2 entities.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In this paper <a href="http://www.mlgworkshop.org/2018/papers/MLG2018_paper_5.pdf">Generalized Embedding Model for Knowledge Graph Mining</a>, they have presented a model for learning neural presentation of generalized knowledge graphs using a novel muli-shot unsupervised neural network model, called the <strong>Graph Embedding Network (GEN)</strong>. This model is able to learn different types of knowlege graphs from a universal perspective and it provides flexibility in learning representations that work on graphs conforming to different domains.</p></li>
<li><p>In this paper <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJ4qXnCqFX">Probabilisic Knowledge Graph Embeddings</a>, they explored a new type of embedding model that can link prediction in relational knowledge graph.</p></li>
