<h1><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Implementing a Teaching Machine</h1>
<p>How might we approach designing such a system.</p>
<p><strong>High level video of all the components in the abstract</strong></p>
<div id="problem-formulation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Problem Formulation</h2>
<p>Let’s begin our investigation by breaking down our high-level goal into a few sub-goals and we will then take a close look at each of them.</p>
<p>In order to create a concrete digital educational user footprint and journey:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>LEARNING + FEEDBACK</strong> – given a user consumes a piece of educational material, reliably evaluate their knowledge and provide the feedback for improvement. (credibility, rigour)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHITECT</strong> – given a piece of educational content, classify it within a knowledge graph. (relatibility, predictability)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MISSION MAPPING </strong> – given multiple student journeys, create a way to customize their own growth journey while offereing a way for them them to compare, connect with and follow, other’s journey (compare, traverse, curiosity)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>SOCIAL BADGE</strong> – given a student journey, collapse it into a representative symbol(s) to help validate the progress (digital education footprint) [dimensionality reducing (i.e. time, )] (relatibility, stable but evolving system )</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to create a adequate system that can take on this mission and vision that we shared above, much of it (1, 2) have been made possible with the recent breakthoughs in deep learning. A few cases like (3,4) may require a more advanced deep learning architecture that has been proposed yet to our knowledge. Let’s first take a look at some methods that might come handy when tackling our problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-deep-learning" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Why deep learning?</h2>
<p>If you look closely at each set of questions that we listed above, it is not hard to find that those questions are solvable by the machines. Let’s take the first problem as an example, to create a learning and evaluation system we need to somehow find the connection of the educational material we provided and the meaningful and reliable question &amp; answer set that is associated with the content. In other words, our problem could be simplified as trying to find a function that is able to learn the relationship between our input and output and appropriately map the input to the desired output with this function.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, deep learning seems to be one of the best techniques currently developed that is able to tackle such a fuzzy issue. First of all, deep learning is known as one of the most flexible machine learning algorithms that can learn and map the <strong>deep representation</strong> from the data and in turn contribute to our unique set of problems i.e. automatic question and answer gnerating or visual question answering problems. Moreover, by leveraging neural network architecture, deep nueral networks architecture can be composed into a single differentiable function and trained end-to-end and they can help identify the suitable <em>inductive</em> <em>biases</em> catered to the input data type.</p>
</div>
<div id="before-we-start" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Before we start…</h2>
<p>With the belief that we can and we will find a solution for such a Teaching machine, we are set out to find the possible solutions. As what we discussed above, one of the possible and optimal solutions so far is using current state-of-art deep learning frameworks in related domains for such difficult tasks. Here I will walk you through some thought provinking research findings in a form of survey.</p>
<p>To best illustrate the problem and possible solutions, I will reduce the complexity of the problem for now. Keep in mind that our ultimate goal is to be able to use our system in any type of online available educational material. For now, we will just focus on one of the most popular ones - Video educational content.</p>
