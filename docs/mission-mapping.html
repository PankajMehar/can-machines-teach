<p>The key to create an education or a learning/teaching system is to be able to present a high quality study material and provide a high quality feedback on student’s learning.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with the first issue, we can easily identify the association of our problem with a problem that has been solved with recommender system.</p>
<p>As we all know that a recommender system is an intuitive line of defense against consumer over-choice given the evern growing information available on the web. As we mentioned earlier in the knowledge graph, a authoritative and personalized recommending system is essential for facilitating the learning.</p>
<p>Typically, a recommendation models can be classified into 3 main categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Collaborative filtering</p></li>
<li><p>Content based</p></li>
<li><p>Hybrid recommender system</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As I mentioned, here we will mainly focus on hybrid recommender system.</p>
<p>There are a diverse array of achitectual paradigms that are closely related recommending system. Let’s take a look at few of them: 1. Autoencoder</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Convolutional Neural Network</p></li>
<li><p>Recurrent Neural Network</p></li>
<li><p>Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)</p></li>
<li><p>Adversarial Networks</p></li>
<li><p>Attentional Models (AM)</p></li>
<li><p>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)</p></li>
