<p>The concept of a digital education footprint is is a custom symbol and profile that represents one’s education relative to that of others. Each symbol should be somewhat unique and the profile could capture the general education as well as the intricacies.</p>
<p>A symbol which represents somethng as complex as one’s education will likely not be enough for employeers and co-workers to understand the . A symbol must show that one is in a particular “class” while also Symbols generally have to make trade-offs</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.0.3</span> Human Knowledge Graph</h3>
<p>We have so far introduced <strong>digital education footprint</strong> and <strong>journeys</strong>, which claim to be the right elements to synthesis one’s education. But how does one create a path? From video to video? From topic to topic? If so, how might a machine decide on the topic? We have had plenty of advances in topic models but perhaps what we actually need is a graph of human knowledge. This graph, like Google’s knowledge graph, should be generated both from the current structure of education and also driven by unsupervised learning of new topics that don’t exist on today’s knowledge graph.</p>
<p>This graph would be useful so content on the web could be easily mapped to the graph adn relate one user to another as well as create trails.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> From Data to Wisdom (DIKW)</h2>
<p>Over time, it is plausible, that our digital education footprint would be the most important representation of an individuals level of education. Even more important than our primary education; it has done much to make us predictable, but it has sacrificed the true range of an individual’s gained knowledge and wisdom coming from any other place than the institution is willing to give credit for.</p>
<p>Since we’ve largely rely upon large institutions to educate groups of individuals, many have grown deeply familiar with having a perfectly demarcated path towards a degree, so it has been much harder for individuals to use this abundance of knowledge to chart their own educational journey in today’s fast moving world.</p>
<p>being us how to the peer pressure of cohorts, self-learning learned Imagine that if you signed up for a job, your primary consideration and also your digital education could be conveyed as a path through the web that others attempt to follow or mix and match.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Part IV - Survey of empirical results</h2>
<p>In order to create a adequate system that can take on this mission and vision that we shared above, we certainly need to leverage the state-of-art algorithms and even more advanced ones that will be developed soon. Let’s first take a look at some methods that might come handy when tackling our problem.</p>
<p>Note that here we will mainly focus on how to possibly set our foot into this problem by exploring muliple existing deep learning algorithms in the related domains.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-foumlation" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Problem Foumlation</h2>
<p>Let’s begin our investigate by breaking down our goal into few sub-goals and we will then take a close look at each of them.</p>
<p>First, we need to have a hybrid system that can process any learning media (i.e. a video, a e-book or an audio recording clip) and automatically generated a set of questions (both close ended like multi-choice question or open-ended like writing a quick summary) for the learners.</p>
<p>If the questions generated are close-ended, the model should also be able to generate the right answer based on the context provided and evaluate the results answered by the learners.</p>
<p>If the questions generated are open-ended, the model should be able to evaluate the result as well and provide a approximate score as the feedback.</p>
<p>This is our first set of problems - <strong>LEARNING by ANSWERING</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, we need to consider how we can provide an adequate and relevant learning map for the learners based on their progress and the knowledge graph/map given that we have a ever growing amount of educational content on the web.</p>
<p>This is our second set of problems - <strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHITECT</strong>.</p>
<p>What’s more, the knowledge graph might be universal, but everyone’s learning journey is still highly personal and custom. In terms of learning, everyone seems to have their unique set of problems to solve or they are curious about and everyone is on their unique mission towards mastery.</p>
<p>We cannot create an online learning/teaching system without taking this crucial factor into account. In order to put our hands on this set of issues, we can rely on some heuristic and models that have been developed to solve this idiosymcratic issue.</p>
<p>This is our thrid set of problems - <strong>MISSION MAPPING</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-deep-learning" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Why deep learning?</h2>
<p>Just as any other problems that can be solved with deep learning, our problem could be simplied as a function that maps the input to the output. Deep learning is known as one of the most flexible machine learning algorithms that can learn and map the <strong>deep representation</strong> from the data and in turn contribute to our unique set of problems i.e. automatic question and answer gnerating or visual question answering problems. Moreover, by leveraging neural network architecture, deep nueral networks architecture can be composed into a single differentiable function and trained end-to-end and they can help identify the suitable <em>inductive</em> <em>biases</em> catered to the input data type.</p>
