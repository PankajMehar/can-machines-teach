# Introduction 
![Image title](img/MtoQA.png)

Let's start with a future view of an individual's education. Many of us have used the internet to educate ourselves with the abundance of medium to high quality videos, papers, articles, podcasts and how-tos being uploaded from numerous individuals, groups, and institutions like never before (60 hours of video are uploaded to youtube.com every minute). 

Let us imagine that all of what you have learned online, throughout the entirety of your life, from the hundreds of Youtube videos, Wikipedia articles, Nature papers, and podcasts you've read, watched, or listened to, were all added structurally to your **knowledge journey**, and what if that journey could be consolidated into what we might call a **knowledge footprint** that could be shared with others? Could this replace static degrees? Or augment them to be more inclusive of a learner's true knowledge?

Our current approach to education is to treat knowledge acquisition like a chapter in the individual's life that is limited to one or more formal places. This is misleading since we accrue knowledge from everywhere and most recently the internet has become a primary source of knowledge acquisition but has gone mostly unaccounted for in terms of recognition (i.e. watching a whole series of Youtube lectures on the Neurobiology of Depression or Discrete Mathematics goes mostly unnoticed when someone views one's resume or by simply looking at their degree.). This makes it much harder for people to switch to working and exploring outside of their degree area. Knowing rigourous mathematics and not having a degree in it, is said to be surprising, therefore the current "thumbnail view" of an individual's knowlede is neccessarily inadequate to the new mediums of knowledge acquisition.

The ideas behind this *knowledge ecosystem*, presents only one of many possible solutions to bringing our education system into modernity. The goal of it would be to promote the long held idea of the life-long learner. Moving away from the "education chapter"" of an individual's life to the individual as an evolving learner; learning the necessary skills for what life presents them with today or might tomorrow. It would (combined with traditional education) show us a more accurate depiction of a learner's knowledge and theorefore that of a society's collective knowledge. 
 
 
 Visualised over time, we could begin to capture a learner's so called **knowledge journey**.
 Composed of every piece of content they've gained knowledge from mapped to the *human knowledge graph*. Showing how an individual has traversed through the world of human knowledge.
 
 This would also serve as a way for others, who may be on a similar **knowledge journey** to connect with their cohort. This could be the start of meetups, study groups, and so on.
 
 For those who are looking for a change, they may find different journeys that help them decide what step to take next. You would also be able to connect someone's occupation to their **knowledge journey**. 
 
On aggregate, we could begin to cluster similar **knowledge journeys** through unsupervised learning, which might lead to completely new journeys or combinations of subjects at differnet levels that others may be inspired to follow.
 
In this essay, I will propose a **knowledge ecosystem**, a new way of approaching education that attempts to build a more accurate depiction of a learner's true knowledge. It will require significant effort to bring to life but I believe the benefits will outweigh the costs. I will talk about how we can use machine learning, deep learning in particular, to help create and support a **knowledge ecosystem** which is made up of a **knowledge footprint**, **knowledge journeys**, and a **collective human knowledge graph**. We will also introduce current advances in deep learning that would enable us to take the space of unstructured educational content on the web and do the following,
- classify content to higher level subjects
- map content unto the human knowledge graph
- test a learner\'s knowledge of recently viewed educationcal content through questions and answers, no what matter the subject. 


I will also argue that this imagined future is not only **desirable** for society but something similar is required to insure individual's knowledge are well represented in a time where the pace of change is rapidly speeding up. 
Let us not forget, that even software engineering is currently being recreated with machine learning as a key pillar which wasn't much of a thought 5-10 years ago.

As the future pushes us forward, it is tantamount that we have adaptative systems that can represent our current knowledge and also make us predictable to others given the future pushes us to knowing more than ever and knowing who to collaborate with to apply such knowledge.

This hypothetical future isn't just conceptual, most of what I will present to you today is currently feasible due to the most recent advances in machine learning, and in particular deep learning

In the last section of this essay I will review what has been proposed and also call other researchers, teachers, and designers to collaborate on such an ecosystem, even if it is just in part. 

<small>*For the purpose of this essay we will talk mostly about digital knowledge acquisition and leave the reader to extend the basics to knowledge obtained elsewhere.</small>


# Primary Concerns

 There are 3 popular concerns that I will attempt to address in this article about online knowledge acquisition that stand in the way of having an adaptive and reliable knowledge ecosystem. I will attempt to present a system that can sufficiently overcome each of the concerns here and in the implementation section.

There are as follows:

- **Passive Consumption** - most of online content is viewed passively by the learner and the result of passive consumption is that learner's do not grasp the concepts or master the content being taught.
- **Untested Knowledge** - even if the learner was engaged while viewing a piece of educational content their knowledge is untested and therefore it isn't clear if they've mastered the content accurately and in some sense holistically. 
- **Knowledge Representation** - even if the learner was engaged (1) and their knowledge was tested (2), simply knowing the counts or types of video they watched doesn't make their knowledge predictable and useful to others. In fact, even the learner may be unaware of all of what they've viewed. 
 

## Passive Consumption and Untested Knowledge

> How would such an ecosystem insure us against passive consumption?

Scenario #1:
A learner goes online and begins watching a series on Machine Learning. How do we engage and test a user's knowledge?

Proposition:
Using advances in deep learning, we propose a dual question and answer generation given the educational content. 

Result:
A learner gets a set of questions and multiple choice answers throughout the video. Keeping the user engaged and sharp to ensure they can answer each of the questions. 


As you can see, I've bundled passive consumption and untested knowledge because our proposed ecosystem approaches both of these by always testing knowledge. I will show the current results in deep learning in the implementation stage. 

## Knowledge Ecosystem Example

![Knowledge Ecosystem](img/knowledgeEcosystem.png)

Given a piece of educational content, our knowledge system will generate a set of questions and answers that theoretically capture the major concepts and facts that the learner should know after viewing a part or the content in whole. 

You can imagine watching a Youtube video and after a learner views 15 minutes of an hour long lecture on computational complexity a quiz is presented (a set of questions and answers conditioned on the past 15 minutes of video,) and the results are recorded.  In the future we would also be able to use the knowledge graph 

The knowledge system would only consider content that has been watched with some engagement or if they can test out of the content. 


## The Problem of Knowledge Representation

> Given how many learner's online knowledge acquisition varies and has been invisible up to now, how we can best represent their knowledge?

Scenario #2:
A learner has a degree in Public Health, but since graduating, they've been studying machine learning for the last 3 years. The learner now wants to apply to a job that requires Health and Statistics. How do we represent their traditional and updated knowledge?

This is a tricky problem that goes beyond any given algorithm. The exact design of a **knowledge footprint** and a **knowledge journey** has been attempted and we will not cover that in depth here. The proposed system presupposed the design of the knowledge footprint. 

There are two problems,
> how do we reduce someone's knowledge (in this case a set of educational content and their respective scores) into a symbol


Proposition:
We introduce **knowledge journeys** and the **knowledge graph** as a way to make sense and structure a learner's knowledge acquisition. The collective **knowledge graph** will tell us about the subject the learner is studying and we can use this to compare to others and create a relative comparison. 

Result:
You could imagine that reducing a learner's **knowledge journey** into a common set of elements that fit into their **knowledge footprint** which would look similar to those with similar journeys. So the employeer, now familiar with the footprints can see the overlap between the current employee's and a prospective employee.

# Concepts 

## Knowledge Footprint
The concept of a digital education footprint is is a custom symbol and profile that represents one's education relative to that of others. Each symbol should be somewhat unique and the profile could capture the general education as well as the intricacies. 

A symbol which represents somethng as complex as one's education will likely not be enough for employeers and co-workers to understand the . A symbol must show that one is in a particular "class" while also  Symbols generally have to make trade-offs

## Knowledge Journeys

 between the complexity of what it represents and it's ability to convey , the legi from dealing with the task of reduction of info. So we introduce **Journeys** which show how someone has traversed the uy
If most people had their digital education footprint, they would be 

## Collective Human Knowledge Graph
![Image title](img/knowledge_graphy.png)
The knowledge graph will be the backbone of a learners journey through human knowledge. As a learner continues to consume educational content, their fingerprint as wethe learner watches new content they extend their knowledge graph either stre current links 


We have so far introduced **knowledge footprint** and **knowledge journeys**, which claim to be the right elements to synthesise one's education while capturing the complexity on one hand and making the learner relatable and predictable on the other hand. But how does one create a path? From video to video? From topic/subject to topic/subject? If so, how might a machine decide on the correct topic(s)? We have had plenty of advances in topic models but perhaps what we actually need to combine topic models with a graph of human knowledge. This graph, like Google or Wolfram's knowledge graph, should be generated both from the current structure of education and also driven by the unsupervised learning of new topics/subjects that do not currently exist within our current structure. 

This graph would be useful so content on the web could be easily mapped to the graph adn relate one user to another as well as create trails.

## Knowledge Ecosystem Example

![Knowledge Ecosystem](img/knowledgeEcosystem.png)
Now that we are aware of each element let's talk about how it works.


A learner watches a video titled 'Depression' by Robert Sapolsky.
- The video is classified by a neural network as [Neuroscience, Mental Health, Psychology]
- The subjects are then mapped to the **knowledge graph**
- Using EC2QA or similar, a set of questions and answers are generated for every 15* minutes of video
A learner is present with 5 questions to answer and scores 4/5 (80%)
- The link between user and video takes up the score
At the end of the video, the learner records a video summary and is evaluated with a 7/10 (70%)
- The evaluation network looks at the **semantic and conceptual mututal information** shared between the original content and the learner's video summary
- All scores are mapped to the video and also counted at the subject level
A learner looks at their knowledge footprint
- All scores should be calculated against all subjects coming from the knowledge graph and compared against other learners to generate the footprint


### EC2QA Network 
We mentioned the EC2QA network earlier because currently we would have to cobble together multiple networks to make this work. Instead we will introduce a novel network architecture, EC2QA, to solve the problem of generating a set of questions and answer pairs for any given educational content (text, video, image, pdf).
